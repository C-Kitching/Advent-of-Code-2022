# Advent-of-Code-2022

Solutions were mainly done in C++, a few of the more complicated problems were done in python. \
There is a single folder for each day which contains the solution files, my data files and the test cases. \
All solutions are self contained so don't need any external libraries or header files to be used. \
This was my first year doing it so I had to do everything from scratch. \
I will likely try and compile a library of helper functions before next years AOC to try and rank on the leaderboard.
